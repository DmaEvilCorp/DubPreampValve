# DubPreampValve
Project of dub preamp fully equipped with audio tubes.

Will be realized in monophonic, otherwise I might have to use a 12U rack :) and use a pallet truck to move it.
1 microphone input.
1 instrument input.
2 line inputs (switch).
2 phono inputs (switch).
1 active 3-way 24db/octave filter.
3 vu-meters equipped with "magic eye".
1 effects loop.
This project should require 12 to 16 tubes .
Excluding vu meter.

To do:
- Line preamp schematic.
- Phono preamplifier schematic.
- Microphone preamplifier schematic.
- Effects send card schematic.
- 3-way active filter schematic.
- Power supply diagram...
- VU meters schematic.
